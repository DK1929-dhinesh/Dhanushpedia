                <p>
                    Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on the development of machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. The history of AI can be traced back to ancient myths and philosophical discussions about non-human entities with intelligence, but the modern field began to take shape in the mid-20th century.
                </p>

                <h2 id="early-beginnings" class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Early Beginnings (1940s-1950s)</h2>
                <p>
                    The conceptual foundations of AI were laid by pioneers like Alan Turing, who in his 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," proposed a test—now known as the Turing Test—to determine if a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human. The term "artificial intelligence" itself was coined by John McCarthy in 1956 at a workshop held at Dartmouth College, a seminal event often considered the birth of the AI field.
                </p>

                <h2 id="the-golden-years" class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Golden Years (1956-1974)</h2>
                <p>
                    Following the Dartmouth workshop, AI research flourished. Programs like Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon's Logic Theorist, considered the first AI program, and McCarthy's LISP programming language, which became the preferred language for AI research, marked a period of great optimism. Researchers focused on creating systems that could solve mathematical problems and demonstrate logical reasoning. This era saw the development of influential systems such as ELIZA, a natural language processing program, and SHRDLU, which could understand and manipulate objects in a virtual world.
                </p>

                <h2 id="ai-winter" class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The First AI Winter (1974-1980)</h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the early successes, progress slowed significantly by the mid-1970s. The ambitious promises of early AI researchers were not being met, and funding from agencies like DARPA began to dry up. Key challenges included the lack of sufficient computational power and the inherent "common sense" problem—creating machines that could understand the world in the way a human does. This period of reduced interest and funding is known as the "AI Winter."
                </p>

                <h2 id="expert-systems-boom" class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Expert Systems Boom (1980-1987)</h2>
                <p>
                    AI made a comeback in the 1980s with the rise of "expert systems," which were designed to mimic the decision-making ability of human experts. These systems were widely adopted by corporations and were particularly successful in fields like medical diagnosis and mineral exploration. Companies invested heavily in these systems, creating a new wave of optimism.
                </p>

                <h2 id="the-second-ai-winter" class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Second AI Winter (1987-1993)</h2>
                <p>
                    The expert systems boom was short-lived. The high cost of maintaining these systems and their brittle nature—they could not adapt to new knowledge outside their narrow domain—led to another period of disappointment and a second AI Winter.
                </p>

                <h2 id="modern-ai" class="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Modern AI and Machine Learning (1993-Present)</h2>
                <p>
                    The late 1990s and early 2000s saw a resurgence in AI, driven by several key factors. The explosion of the internet led to massive amounts of data becoming available, computational power increased dramatically, and new machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning, emerged. This era saw significant breakthroughs, including IBM's Deep Blue defeating chess champion Garry Kasparov, the development of Google's search algorithm, and the widespread use of recommendation engines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, AI is a pervasive force in technology. From self-driving cars and virtual assistants to medical image analysis and generative art, AI is changing every aspect of our lives. The field continues to evolve at an unprecedented pace, with new research constantly pushing the boundaries of what machines can do.
